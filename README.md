# top-restaurant-page - Javascript Course - The Odin Project

Create a simple restaurant page fully generated by Javascript.

What i learned :
- Rendering DOM only in JS : Just one div in the index.html, all the DOM is generated by JS (instead of the two circles, just for the aesthetic)
- Using Webpack for generate the website
- Dynamic render with Data
